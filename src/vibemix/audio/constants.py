"""LOAD-BEARING tuning constants — French Touch / Daft Punk / Digitalism profile,
125-128 BPM, tuned against real DJ sessions on 2026-05-11. Do not casually re-tune
without a fresh live validation; Phase 6 will add genre-aware overrides on top.

Values lifted VERBATIM from cohost_v4.py — line anchors inline. v4 retuned 8 of
these from v3 for loudness-war-compressed French Touch masters (MUSIC_GAIN_TO_GEMINI
dropped from 8.0, SILENT_RMS / LOW_RMS / PEAK_RMS raised, EVENT_GLOBAL_MIN_GAP
lengthened, HEARTBEAT_SEC lengthened, INVOKE_AUDIO_SECONDS lengthened,
TRACK_CHANGE_MIN_CONFIDENCE added).

Three constants (MUSIC_PRESENCE_MIN_SECONDS, BPM_VALID_MIN, BPM_VALID_MAX) lived
as class-attrs of `EventDetector` in v4 (lines 1178-1182); 02-PATTERNS.md lifts
them OUT to module scope so Phase 3 can import without dragging EventDetector along.

# KICK_KILL_SUB_FLOOR: sub_share floor below which the kick is "killed". Half
# of LAYER_ARRIVAL high_jump magnitude (0.10) — kick removal is a smaller

# not jump (its floor doubles as the no-kick anchor for the re-entry watch).
