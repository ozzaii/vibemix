# vibemix — State

**Last updated:** 2026-05-11 (Phase 2 complete)

---

## Project Reference

- **Project:** vibemix — open-source AI DJ co-host (Bravoh's first OSS release)
- **Core value:** "Real DJ friend in your ear" — never hallucinating, never breaking flow, never AI slop.
- **Current focus:** Roadmap defined. Awaiting kickoff for Phase 1 (Platform Protocol Firewall).
- **Milestone:** v1 (Bravoh-wedge drop) — target ship ~3-4 weeks (~early June 2026, before Bravoh public launch).
- **Project mode:** standard.
- **Granularity:** fine (20 phases).
- **Model profile:** quality (all agents on Opus, all checkpoints on).

---

## Current Position

- **Phase:** 03 — Sensing & State Port (next).
- **Plan:** None active.
- **Status:** Phase 2 ✅ complete (wave commits `bb63774` / `59fdb62` / `54e6432` / `62413e9`). np.concatenate-per-callback regression closed (v4:300 + v4:462). AudioMacOS satisfies Phase 1 AudioBackend Protocol. Sample-rate sanity guard active pre-open + post-open (catches the BlackHole 44100/48000 trap Kaan hit live on 2026-05-11). 14 LOAD-BEARING v4 constants importable at vibemix.audio.constants. POC files untouched. Full suite 78 green; 2 live smoke tests opt-in under macos_audio marker. SignPath OSS submission still pending Kaan-side.
- **Progress:** 2/20 phases complete.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Locked

- Brain swap: `RealtimeModel` → `AgentSession` cascade (`stt=None`, `vad=None`, `llm=google.LLM`, `tts=google.beta.gemini_tts.TTS`). Native Audio code-path stays in repo as opt-in toggle, not the default.
- Architecture: 3-process — Tauri Rust shell + Python sidecar (PyInstaller `--onedir`) + remote FastAPI proxy on `api.altidus.world`.
- API key protection: install-UUID JWT in OS keychain + slowapi/Redis rate limit (60 rpm / 2000 rpd per UUID). Client never holds raw `AIza` key.
- Platforms: macOS 12.3+ and Windows 10/11 in v1. Linux excluded.
- Python: 3.12.x (drop from POC's 3.14 — widest wheel availability for PyInstaller / PyAudioWPatch / scipy).
- License: Apache 2.0 + DCO (per PITFALLS P14 — Bravoh's commercial-internal-use needs).
- Code signing: Apple Developer ID (Kaan has) + SignPath Foundation OSS cert (free for OSS). **Application filed day-1 of Phase 1** (3-week lead time).
- Granularity: fine — 20 phases. Critique → execute loop runs inside every phase (plan-checker before execute, verifier after, ui-checker/auditor between polish iterations, code-reviewer on output).
- Dedicated **Polish Phase (14)** between feature-complete and verification — FL-Studio quality bar, not a final-week sweep.
- Mascot (Avery) is a **first-class feature**, not decoration (Phase 13).

### Open To-dos

- File SignPath Foundation OSS application **on day 1 of Phase 1** (lead time ~3 weeks).
- Collect ~30 min recorded sets per genre (techno / house / D&B / disco / pop) for Phase 6 validation harness; Francesco's DJ network is the obvious source.
- Confirm `.env` was never committed to git (`git log --all --full-history -- .env`); rotate Gemini API key if any doubt.
- Confirm `livekit-plugins-google.beta.gemini_tts.TTS` smoke test in CI (it's in `beta` namespace; need stability check).

### Blockers

None yet — all dependencies are pinned and verified.

### Risks (carried from PITFALLS.md)

- **Critical** P1 (AI slop) and P2 (multimodal hallucination) — existential. Mitigated by prompt-engineering iteration in Phase 10 + verification gates in Phases 16-17.
- **Critical** P3 (API key leakage) — fully mitigated by Phase 5 proxy + Phase 18 binary attack verification.
- **Critical** P6 (day-one installer broken) — mitigated by Phase 18 sign+notarize discipline + Phase 20 fresh-machine rehearsal.
- **High** P14 (license + CLA) — Apache 2.0 + DCO chosen for Bravoh commercial-internal-use compatibility.

## Session Continuity

### Last Session

- 2026-05-11 — Phase 2 (Audio Core Port + Ring Buffer Fix) shipped end-to-end: 4 wave commits (`bb63774` skeleton+constants+Levels, `59fdb62` ring-buffer rewrite fixes np.concatenate at v4:300+v4:462, `54e6432` features.py DSP + VoiceRecorder, `62413e9` AudioMacOS impl + sample-rate guard) + verification gate (8/8 pass) + phase SUMMARY. tracemalloc tests pin zero-alloc invariant on both buffer push paths. AudioMacOS satisfies @runtime_checkable AudioBackend Protocol via isinstance. SampleRateMismatchError raises with Audio MIDI Setup actionable message on both pre-open and post-open paths. Phase 1 firewall test relaxed to skip underscore-prefixed concrete impls (planned amendment per Plan 04 critical constraint). 78 tests green (10 Phase 1 + 14 W1 + 21 W2 + 20 W3 + 13 W4). 2 live BlackHole smoke tests collected under macos_audio marker.

### Next Session

- Continue from Phase 3 (Sensing & State Port).
- Phase 3 will import `vibemix.audio.{AudioBuffer, snapshot_features, energy_curve, long_arc_curve, estimate_bpm, Levels, BufferRegistry, MIN_EVENT_GAP_PER_TYPE, SILENT_RMS, LOW_RMS, PEAK_RMS, MUSIC_PRESENCE_MIN_SECONDS, BPM_VALID_MIN, BPM_VALID_MAX}` directly — no scavenger hunt.
- Kaan-side outstanding: SignPath OSS application (Phase 1 carry-forward). ~1 week SLA.
