# vibemix — Roadmap

**Project:** vibemix — AI DJ Co-Host
**Last shipped:** v7.0 "Open House" — 2026-05-24 (tech_debt accepted; KAAN-ACTION §V7-LIVE / §V7-PROXY / §V7-LANDING / §ASSETS-DEMO-CUT / §SHIP-V4 ride forward on Kaan's clock)
**Current milestone:** none active — run `/gsd:new-milestone` to start the next cycle
**Open alongside:** v4.0 "SHIP" — engineering-complete (8/8), publish gated on the external Apple Dev + SignPath signature clock (NOT archived) — **v7.0's OSS-04 discharges §SHIP-V4 for real; v4.0 closes alongside when the real cut fires**

# v7.0 "Open House" — SHIPPED 2026-05-24 (tech_debt accepted)

<details>
<summary>✅ v7.0 Open House (Phases 67–70) — SHIPPED 2026-05-24 (tech_debt accepted)</summary>

4 phases shipped engineering-green under `gsd-autonomous fully` mode. 20 plans, 37 tasks, 19/19 v7.0 REQ-IDs satisfied (engineering-side), 6/6 cross-phase wirings sound, UI-review PASS 23/24 on the landing. A **WIRING + DISCHARGE + POLISH milestone with ZERO new product capability** — zero net-new dependencies, zero new ws ports, zero new IPC envelopes. The four cardinal invariants (single-writer / citation-grounding / trust-the-audio / one-socket) held by zero-touch (only Phase 69 touched `src/vibemix/agent/` for the client-side proxy fallback).

- [x] Phase 67: All Tests Pass (5/5 plans) — 2026-05-23 (TEST-01..04; default `pytest -q` 0-red, 21-job `full-test-matrix.yml` CI, static skip/flake gates, 10× flake-hunt baseline)
- [x] Phase 68: All Devices Ready (5/5 plans) — 2026-05-23 (DEV-01..05; 10 profile contracts + synthetic-MIDI smokes, catalog reconciled to single `profiles/` source, hot-plug + audio-backend matrices, contributor recipe)
- [x] Phase 69: OSS Fully Integrated (5/5 plans) — 2026-05-24 (OSS-01..05; 4 OSS docs + presence test, client-side proxy fallback "Co-host unavailable this session", BYO-key doc, Homebrew+Scoop scaffolds, §SHIP-V4 publish pre-staged)
- [x] Phase 70: GitHub Sexified, Generated, Tested (5/5 plans) — 2026-05-24 (GH-01..05; asset reproducibility pipeline + auto-gen og-card, CDJ-Whisper Pages landing, demo poster, one-stop `test_github_presence.py`)

**KAAN-ACTION (live-confirm / external-clock, rides forward):** §V7-LIVE-01..11 (live hardware + first-CI-green + BYO walk) + §V7-PROXY (Bravoh server-side hardening) + §V7-LANDING (Pages-live + Kaan-felt aesthetic sign-off + real waitlist URL) + §ASSETS-DEMO-CUT (real 30-sec demo film, Francesco capture) + **§SHIP-V4 (HARD external clock — OSS-04 real `cut_release.sh v0.1.0-rc1` publish, gated on Apple Dev + SignPath; v4.0 "SHIP" closes alongside when it fires)**. All in `KAAN-ACTION-LEGAL.md`.

**Git tag + branch merge deferred** (consistent with v4.0 + v5.0 + v6.0): the `v7.0` tag + `live-tuning-or-brain` → main merge are Kaan's call on his clock (the OSS-04 publish + v4.0 close ride the same signature clock).

# v6.0 "The Memory Turn" — SHIPPED 2026-05-23 (tech_debt accepted)

<details>
<summary>✅ v6.0 The Memory Turn (Phases 63–66) — SHIPPED 2026-05-23 (tech_debt accepted)</summary>

4 phases shipped engineering-green under `gsd-autonomous fully` mode. 12 plans, 14/14 v6.0 REQ-IDs satisfied, 6/6 cross-phase integration seams WIRED, 53/53 must-haves verified, 247/247 v6.0 surface tests GREEN. A **WIRING / REUSE milestone with ZERO net-new dependencies** — built entirely on the shipped `src/vibemix/library/` primitives (sqlite-vec, cosine_topk, embed-cache, grounding pattern, EVIDENCE_SOURCES schema).

- [x] Phase 63: Memory Store (3/3 plans) — 2026-05-22 (STORE-01..04 GREEN; 19/19 tests/memory/)
- [x] Phase 64: Session Ingest (3/3 plans) — 2026-05-22 (INGEST-01..03 GREEN; one v1 moment kind = `coach_line`; `moment` cut, `audio_moment` deferred)
- [x] Phase 65: Memory Retrieval Seam — ANTI-SLOP RELEASE GATE (4/4 plans) — 2026-05-22 (RECALL-01..04 GREEN; existence-only `recall` source à la P59 `key:`, fabricated `[recall:<id>]` strips whole turn)
- [x] Phase 66: Visible Copilot Move (2/2 plans) — 2026-05-22 (COPILOT-01..03 GREEN; transition-shape + vocabulary callbacks; ships behind `VIBEMIX_RECALL_ENABLED=0` until §RECALL-EAR Kaan-ear pass)

**KAAN-ACTION (live-confirm, rides forward):** §RECALL-EAR felt-quality discharge (4 ear items) + §LIVE-EMBED real-session FLEX-tier round-trip + two doc-drifts (code correct) + STORE-03 recordings-UI call-site (out of v6.0 scope; future recordings-UI phase). All in `KAAN-ACTION-LEGAL.md §RECALL-EAR` + `66-HUMAN-UAT.md`.

**Git tag deferred** (consistent with v4.0 + v5.0): the `v6.0` tag + branch merge are Kaan's call on his clock.

# v5.0 "The Useful Cut" — SHIPPED 2026-05-22 (tech_debt accepted)

<details>
<summary>✅ v5.0 The Useful Cut (Phases 59–62) — SHIPPED 2026-05-22 (tech_debt accepted)</summary>

Deck-aware, actionable, unobtrusive. Full session-wide deck-state (pyrekordbox XML → Gemini-vision → numpy ladder) with a citable `key:` evidence source; a deterministic Camelot harmonic key-clash gate the LLM only narrates (ships **default-OFF** behind the Kaan-ear veto); an actionable-not-hype coach persona extending the `live-tuning-or-brain` branch (hype goldens regression-fenced); and a transparent, draggable, non-focus-stealing **floating pill** as the primary live surface (Three.js mascot kept opt-in/secondary, mascot-audit green). 4/4 phases, 17/17 requirements satisfied, 4/4 cross-phase integration seams WIRED.

- [x] Phase 59: Full Deck Awareness + Grounding (5/5 plans) — 2026-05-21
- [x] Phase 60: Harmonic-Feedback Confidence Gate (4/4 plans) — 2026-05-21 (detector default-OFF until the Kaan-ear veto flip)
- [x] Phase 61: Actionable-Not-Hype Coach Persona (2/2 plans) — 2026-05-21
- [x] Phase 62: Floating Pill UI (5/5 plans) — 2026-05-22

# v4.0 SHIP — OPEN (engineering-complete 8/8, publish on signature clock — NOT archived)

> **Status:** All 8 phases (51–58) are engineering-complete. The milestone is deliberately **left open and unarchived** — its public RC publish stays gated on the external signature clock (Apple Dev Agreement via Francesco + SignPath OSS cert). **v7.0's OSS-04 actually consumes this publish** (closes alongside §SHIP-V4 discharge). Do not delete or archive this section until OSS-04 fires.

<details>
<summary>🟡 v4.0 SHIP (Phases 51–58) — engineering-complete 2026-05-21, publish on signature clock</summary>

- [x] Phase 51: Real-Hardware Bring-Up (3/3 plans) — 2026-05-21
- [x] Phase 52: Audio Path + Feature Grounding (4/4 plans) — 2026-05-21
- [x] Phase 53: Controller Live + Graceful Fallback (2/2 plans) — 2026-05-21
- [x] Phase 54: Hype Mode Live (4/4 plans) — 2026-05-20
- [x] Phase 55: Feedback Mode Live + Citation Integrity (3/3 plans) — 2026-05-21
- [x] Phase 56: Performance + Live Mascot (3/3 plans) — 2026-05-21
- [x] Phase 57: Sexify Finish (3/3 plans) — 2026-05-21
- [x] Phase 58: Ship Readiness (4/4 plans) — 2026-05-21 (`cut_release.sh --dry-run v0.1.0-rc1` GREEN; publish hard-guard regression-pinned)

**Critical path at close:** External clock — Apple Dev Agreement (Francesco) + SignPath OSS Foundation (Kaan, ~1-week SLA). `KAAN-ACTION-LEGAL.md §SHIP-V4` documents the one-button SHIP-CUT sequence. **v4.0 closes alongside v7.0 OSS-04.**

*Roadmap extended 2026-05-23 for v7.0 "Open House" — **4 phases (67–70)** continuing numbering from v6.0 (which ran 63–66). v4.0 "SHIP" stays OPEN and unarchived above — its publish closes alongside v7.0's OSS-04 (KAAN-ACTION §SHIP-V4 discharge fires `cut_release.sh v0.1.0-rc1` for real). v7.0 derives from 19 requirements across 4 pillars (TEST · DEV · OSS · GH), one phase per pillar, sized by `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` Traceability — 4/5/5/5 REQ-IDs per phase, zero orphans, zero duplicates. **Hard scope rule (locked):** v7.0 is WIRING + DISCHARGE + POLISH — zero new product capability, zero new AI providers, zero new managed-memory frameworks, zero new ws ports, zero new IPC envelopes. The four cardinal invariants (single-writer / citation grounding / "trust the audio" / one socket) hold by zero-touch — no phase modifies the reaction path. The v4.0 external signature clock is unchanged. Critical path: P67 (test infrastructure, dependency-free) → P68 (controller catalog reconciliation + audio backends, lands on P67's CI matrix) → P69 (OSS surface + actual publish gated on §SHIP-V4) → P70 (GitHub front-porch + Kaan-felt landing-page sign-off). Under `gsd-autonomous fully`, OSS-04 routes to §SHIP-V4 if signatures haven't landed at execution; the other 18 REQ-IDs ship unblocked.*
